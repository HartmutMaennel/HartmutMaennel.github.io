<h1>Notes</h1>

<h2>Krull dimension</h2>
Supremum of the lengths of all chains of prime ideals 
(the length is the number of strict inclusions, not the number of primes; these differ by 1).

<br/>
A field has dimension 0.<br/>
A PID that is not a field has dimension 1. <br/>
An integral extension of a ring has the same dimension as the ring does. <br/>

<h2>Local rings</h2>
A commutative ring is local if and only if it has a unique maximal ideal.<br/>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_ring">Wikipedia</a><br/>

<h2>Regular Local Ring</h2>
A regular local ring is a Noetherian local ring having the property that 
 the minimal number of generators of its maximal ideal is equal to its Krull dimension. <br/>

<h2>Depth</h2>

<h2>Cohen-Macaulay Ring</h2>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krull_dimension">Wikipedia</a><br/>
For example, the ring k[x,y]/(x^2,xy) (where k is a field), 
which represents a line (x=0) with an embedded double point at the origin,
has depth zero at the origin, but dimension one: 
this gives an example of a ring which is not Cohenâ€“Macaulay.
